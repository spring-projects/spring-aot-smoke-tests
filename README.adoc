Smoke tests for Spring's ahead-of-time (AOT) and GraalVM native image support.
Results are published to a https://spring-asa-aot-smoke-tests-dashboard.azuremicroservices.io[dashboard].

== Repository Structure

This branch contains only GitHub Actions workflows.
It is the default branch in the repository to work around a limitation of GitHub Actions' https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule[scheduling support]:

> Scheduled workflows run on the latest commit on the default or base branch.

Additionally, scheduling will only work for a workflow that exists in the default branch.
To overcome this limitation, this branch contains workflows for every smoke test found in the `3.2.x`, `3.3.x`, `3.4.x` and `main` branches.
If you're looking for the smoke tests themselves, please take a look at one of those other branches:

- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-aot-smoke-tests/tree/3.2.x[3.2.x]
- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-aot-smoke-tests/tree/3.3.x[3.3.x]
- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-aot-smoke-tests/tree/3.4.x[3.4.x]
- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-aot-smoke-tests/tree/main[main]



== Managing the Workflows

The workflows can be updated automatically but doing so relies upon a particular directory structure using Git's worktree support:

[source,]
----
spring-aot-smoke-tests
├── 3.2.x
├── 3.3.x
├── 3.4.x
├── ci
└── main
----



=== Initial Setup

To create this directory structure, first clone the repository into a directory named `ci`:

[source,]
----
mkdir spring-aot-smoke-tests
cd spring-aot-smoke-tests
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-aot-smoke-tests ci
cd ci
----

Now, create worktrees for the `3.2.x`, `3.3.x`, `3.4.x`, and `main` branches:

[source,]
----
git worktree add ../3.2.x 3.2.x
git worktree add ../3.3.x 3.3.x
git worktree add ../3.4.x 3.4.x
git worktree add ../main main
----

The smoke tests resolve commercial dependencies from https://repo.spring.io which requires authentication.
Use the `REPO_SPRING_IO_USERNAME` and `REPO_SPRING_IO_PASSWORD` environment variables to provide the necessary credentials.



=== Updating the Workflows

To sync the workflows, make sure you're in the `ci` worktree on the `ci` branch and execute the following Gradle build:

[source,]
----
./gradlew syncGitHubActionsWorkflows
----

This will update the workflows in the `ci` branch based on the smoke tests in each of the repository's other branches.
Commit and push any changes.
