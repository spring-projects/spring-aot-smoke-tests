== Docker Compose tips

If your smoke test uses Docker Compose here are few tips:

* Wrap your port values in single quotes (`'8080'`)
* Do not specify hardcoded port mappings in `docker-compose.yml` - use `'8080'` rather than `'8080':'8080'`
* Configure your sample app to use the dynamic host (`YOUR_SVC_HOST`) and port (`YOUR_SVC_PORT`) property (see an https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-aot-smoke-tests/blob/main/data/data-jdbc-postgresql/src/main/resources/application.properties[example])
